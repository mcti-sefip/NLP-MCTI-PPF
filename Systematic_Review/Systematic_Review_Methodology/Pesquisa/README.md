# Automation of Systematic literature reviews classifications

## Objective

The present repository is an implementation of First-order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) with SciBERT for Systematic Literature Review Classification (Finn et al., 2017; Nichol et al., 2018; Beltagy et al., 2019).

The main objective is to implement few-shot classification by training our learner with multiple cycles of few examples sourced by domains datasets using just the Title concatenated with the abstract of a research paper. Therefore, the model will acheive a good initialization of weights in order to perform a classification/ranking on the unlabeled data, training the model with few labaled domain's examples. Our model is a direct adaptation of Wang work (Wang et al.,2021) paired with some layers of SciBERT, for the purpose of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) automation. 

To use the model, the folder [Application](https://github.com/BecomeAllan/ML-SLRC/tree/main/Application) has a notebook example that can be used to conduct a Systematic Literature Review classification using the Semantic Scholar as a tool for retrive scientific literature data or can be direct downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/becomeallan/ML-SLRC).

## Notebook requirements (versions used)

* python (3.7.13)
* pytorch (1.11.0)
* transformers (4.16.2)
* torchmetrics (0.8.0)
* matplotlib (3.5.1)

## Datasets

The 64 pre-processed topics labeled datasets proposed can be downloaded from the [Meta_learning_EFL.ipynb](https://github.com/BecomeAllan/ML-SLRC/blob/main/Meta_learning_EFL.ipynb) notebook and make sure all data is in a `SLR_data` folder. Alternatively, the originals datasets can be downloaded in [dropbox source](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bs7eawof65l39ny/AAB_WucrCX04o-IAPjtYLMlva?dl=0).
