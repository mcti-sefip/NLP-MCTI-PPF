",How we work,"The Academy pursues an interdisciplinary approach to policy. We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

Dennis and Mireille Gillings Foundation In 2018 the Academy of Medical Sciences received a pledge of Â£600,000 from the Dennis and Mireille Gillings Foundation towards a pilot programme to develop two cohorts of innovative new leaders in medical science. The FLIER programme has now supported 35 individuals in two pilot cohorts - discover the programme here. Dr Mireille Gillings, neuroscientist, business entrepreneur and founder of HUYA Bioscience International said: ""Future leaders in the biomedical and health sector will need to be brilliant scientists that can manage money and medicine. I am confident that the FLIER programme will give researchers expertise in what I call the 3M's - management, money and medicine. Skills across the 3M's will help get new drugs to patients faster. We are delighted to contribute to this new programme that will help fill this gap. "" Yusuf and Farida Hamied Foundation The Hamied Foundation UK-India Antimicrobial Resistance Visiting Professorship Scheme supports the travel and subsistence costs of UK researchers visiting India to develop long-term collaborations on the highly important topic of antimicrobial research. The grant also includes funding for two scientific meetings on antimicrobial resistance, one in the UK and one in India. This innovative new scheme was announced in Autumn 2017 as part of a wider initiative aiming to tackle antimicrobial resistance, championed by Professor Dame Sally Davies DBE FRS FMedSci, Chief Medical Officer for England and generously supported by the Yusuf and Farida Hamied Foundation.

Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health.

",About the Adaptation Fund,"About the Adaptation Fund The Adaptation Fund finances projects and programmes that help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change. Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities. Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives.

Dennis and Mireille Gillings Foundation In 2018 the Academy of Medical Sciences received a pledge of Â£600,000 from the Dennis and Mireille Gillings Foundation towards a pilot programme to develop two cohorts of innovative new leaders in medical science. The FLIER programme has now supported 35 individuals in two pilot cohorts - discover the programme here. Dr Mireille Gillings, neuroscientist, business entrepreneur and founder of HUYA Bioscience International said: ""Future leaders in the biomedical and health sector will need to be brilliant scientists that can manage money and medicine. I am confident that the FLIER programme will give researchers expertise in what I call the 3M's - management, money and medicine. Skills across the 3M's will help get new drugs to patients faster. We are delighted to contribute to this new programme that will help fill this gap. "" Yusuf and Farida Hamied Foundation The Hamied Foundation UK-India Antimicrobial Resistance Visiting Professorship Scheme supports the travel and subsistence costs of UK researchers visiting India to develop long-term collaborations on the highly important topic of antimicrobial research. The grant also includes funding for two scientific meetings on antimicrobial resistance, one in the UK and one in India. This innovative new scheme was announced in Autumn 2017 as part of a wider initiative aiming to tackle antimicrobial resistance, championed by Professor Dame Sally Davies DBE FRS FMedSci, Chief Medical Officer for England and generously supported by the Yusuf and Farida Hamied Foundation. The Daniel Turnberg Memorial Fund established by Lord and Lady Turnberg The Daniel Turnberg Memorial Fund was set up by Lord and Lady Turnberg in memory of their late son Daniel Turnberg, a doctor and researcher with a keen interest in fostering links between the UK, Israel and the Middle East. The Fund supports both short-term exchange visits between the UK and the Middle East and wider networking conferences. These enable early- and mid-career scientists in the UK and the Middle East to experience an alternative research environment, learn new techniques and develop ideas for future collaborations.

",About the Adaptation Fund,"About the Adaptation Fund The Adaptation Fund finances projects and programmes that help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change. Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities. Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives. The Fund is financed largely by government and private donors, and also from a two percent share of proceeds of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) issued under the Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism projects.

SumyReduction,"The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. ",How we work,"The Academy pursues an interdisciplinary approach to policy. We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

Dennis and Mireille Gillings Foundation In 2018 the Academy of Medical Sciences received a pledge of Â£600,000 from the Dennis and Mireille Gillings Foundation towards a pilot programme to develop two cohorts of innovative new leaders in medical science. The FLIER programme has now supported 35 individuals in two pilot cohorts - discover the programme here. Dr Mireille Gillings, neuroscientist, business entrepreneur and founder of HUYA Bioscience International said: ""Future leaders in the biomedical and health sector will need to be brilliant scientists that can manage money and medicine. I am confident that the FLIER programme will give researchers expertise in what I call the 3M's - management, money and medicine. Skills across the 3M's will help get new drugs to patients faster. We are delighted to contribute to this new programme that will help fill this gap. "" Yusuf and Farida Hamied Foundation The Hamied Foundation UK-India Antimicrobial Resistance Visiting Professorship Scheme supports the travel and subsistence costs of UK researchers visiting India to develop long-term collaborations on the highly important topic of antimicrobial research. The grant also includes funding for two scientific meetings on antimicrobial resistance, one in the UK and one in India. This innovative new scheme was announced in Autumn 2017 as part of a wider initiative aiming to tackle antimicrobial resistance, championed by Professor Dame Sally Davies DBE FRS FMedSci, Chief Medical Officer for England and generously supported by the Yusuf and Farida Hamied Foundation. The Daniel Turnberg Memorial Fund established by Lord and Lady Turnberg The Daniel Turnberg Memorial Fund was set up by Lord and Lady Turnberg in memory of their late son Daniel Turnberg, a doctor and researcher with a keen interest in fostering links between the UK, Israel and the Middle East. The Fund supports both short-term exchange visits between the UK and the Middle East and wider networking conferences. These enable early- and mid-career scientists in the UK and the Middle East to experience an alternative research environment, learn new techniques and develop ideas for future collaborations.

SumyReduction,"About the Adaptation Fund The Adaptation Fund finances projects and programmes that help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change. Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives. ",About the Adaptation Fund,"About the Adaptation Fund The Adaptation Fund finances projects and programmes that help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change. Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities.

SumyLuhn,"We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. ",How we work,"The Academy pursues an interdisciplinary approach to policy. We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health.

Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities.

SumyLsa,"The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. ",How we work,"The Academy pursues an interdisciplinary approach to policy. We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities. Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives. The Fund is financed largely by government and private donors, and also from a two percent share of proceeds of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) issued under the Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism projects.

SumyLexRank,"They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. ",How we work,"The Academy pursues an interdisciplinary approach to policy. We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

",About the Adaptation Fund,"About the Adaptation Fund The Adaptation Fund finances projects and programmes that help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change. Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities. Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives.

SumyTextRank,"The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. ",How we work,"The Academy pursues an interdisciplinary approach to policy. We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives. ",About the Adaptation Fund,"About the Adaptation Fund The Adaptation Fund finances projects and programmes that help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change. Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities.

We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities. Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives. The Fund is financed largely by government and private donors, and also from a two percent share of proceeds of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) issued under the Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism projects.

Transformers-google/pegasus-xsum,"The Academy of Medical Sciences is a not-for-profit organisation with a mission to improve the state of medical science and health in the UK and around the world, and to promote the development and diffusion of high-quality, cutting-edge science.",How we work,"The Academy pursues an interdisciplinary approach to policy. We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

Transformers-csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum,"The British Academy of Science is a leading academic institution, which aims to promote the ability of scientists to develop their careers. Here's what we learned about the science policy work of the Academy.",How we work,"The Academy pursues an interdisciplinary approach to policy. We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry. This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership - formally and informally - with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy's Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication. "

Transformers-csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum,"The Adaptation Fund, which aims to help the most vulnerable countries and communities adapt to climate change, has been established by the United Nations.",About the Adaptation Fund,"About the Adaptation Fund The Adaptation Fund finances projects and programmes that help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change. Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities. Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives. The Fund is financed largely by government and private donors, and also from a two percent share of proceeds of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) issued under the Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism projects.
