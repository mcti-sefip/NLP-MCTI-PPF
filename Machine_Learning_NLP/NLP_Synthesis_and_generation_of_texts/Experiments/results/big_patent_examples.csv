SumyRandom,"01 to 0 . 01 to 0 . raising the chloride ion concentration increases the electrical conductivity of the gel and decreases the gel - skin impedance , and conversely lowering the chloride ion concentration decreases the electrical conductivity of the gel and increases gel - skin impedance . 0 gm of propylene glycol until dissolved . ","a cohesive nonsticky electrically conductive gel is disclosed , for facilitating low resistance contact between a metal electrode and a biological body . the gel comprises an aqueous solution of up to saturated concentrations of ionized salts as the conducting agent , a natural gum capable of crosslinking , and a crosslinking material which provides the electrically conductive gel with sufficient internal strength to remain cohesive without reinforcement . the gel has good electrical characteristics and improved physical properties which prevent the gel from leaving a messy residue on the skin of the patient or on the electrode .","the present invention provides an electrolyte gel based on a crosslinked natural gum as the thickening agent . the preferred gums are guar gum and locust bean gum . structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . one feature of the natural gums is their ready availability and low cost . a feature of guar gum is that it can be obtained in a rather pure state without extensive processing . guar gum in its natural state is relatively pure , having very few impurities such as sulphur ( sometimes found in agar ) or extraneous ions ( as found in many of the less pure gums ). a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . in addition , the natural ph of guar gum gels of this invention is approximately 7 - 8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e . , high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g . , the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g . , temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc . , a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g . , methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention ."

SumyLuhn,"a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . raising the chloride ion concentration increases the electrical conductivity of the gel and decreases the gel - skin impedance , and conversely lowering the chloride ion concentration decreases the electrical conductivity of the gel and increases gel - skin impedance . raising the borate ion concentration increases the degree of crosslinking and the stiffness of the gel , and conversely lowering the borate ion concentration decreases the degree of crosslinking and thus the stiffness of the gel . 4 gm of guar gum powder ( commercially available as jaguar ® a2s from the stein hall co . ) are added to the water and the mixture is stirred vigorously , e . g . , with a homo - mixer , until a homogeneous mixture is obtained ( 15 - 20 minutes ). ","a cohesive nonsticky electrically conductive gel is disclosed , for facilitating low resistance contact between a metal electrode and a biological body . the gel comprises an aqueous solution of up to saturated concentrations of ionized salts as the conducting agent , a natural gum capable of crosslinking , and a crosslinking material which provides the electrically conductive gel with sufficient internal strength to remain cohesive without reinforcement . the gel has good electrical characteristics and improved physical properties which prevent the gel from leaving a messy residue on the skin of the patient or on the electrode .","the present invention provides an electrolyte gel based on a crosslinked natural gum as the thickening agent . the preferred gums are guar gum and locust bean gum . structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . one feature of the natural gums is their ready availability and low cost . a feature of guar gum is that it can be obtained in a rather pure state without extensive processing . guar gum in its natural state is relatively pure , having very few impurities such as sulphur ( sometimes found in agar ) or extraneous ions ( as found in many of the less pure gums ). a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . in addition , the natural ph of guar gum gels of this invention is approximately 7 - 8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e . , high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g . , the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g . , temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc . , a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g . , methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

SumyLuhn,"further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . ","a log rolling apparatus includes a body having a depression or well positioned therein and a large sheet of canvas or similar flexible material positioned over the body and the well . the canvas is fixedly attached to respective ends of the body and a dual link pivotal member is provided to which is attached a roller movable between the body and the canvas . sheets of flammable material and optionally other burnable material , such as leaves or the like , may be placed within the well over the top surface of the canvas , and the pivotal member may then be rotated about the body in a manner which causes the canvas to attempt to follow the roller attached to the member , thus causing the top surface of the canvas to slide against itself so as to roll up the flammable sheet material into a log shape with the leaves , if used , enclosed by the sheet material .","with reference now to the drawings and in particular to fig1 a log rolling apparatus incorporating the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be discussed in detail . specifically , fig1 shows the log rolling apparatus 10 as including a body member 12 having a topmost curved surface 14 extending over a substantial portion of the body member , and further including a depression or well 16 formed therein as an integral part thereof . further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . viewing fig1 and 2 together , it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus 10 further includes a rotation member 28 which is formed from a pair of first pivot arms 30 , 32 pivotally attached to opposed sides 34 , 36 , respectively , of the body member 12 and second pivot arms 38 , 40 respectively pivotally attached to the pivot arms 30 , 32 . additionally , the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are connected together through the use of a handle member 42 in the manner illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , the roller 52 is rotatably positioned on a roller shaft 56 fixedly secured to the second pivot arms 38 , 40 , while spring 57 is provided which is attached between the body member 12 and the pivotable arm 30 so as to facilitate a return of the rotation member 28 to the position shown in fig1 . as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention ."

fill and fresh pack processes , it is desirable to add the rolled oats at a point in the preparation so that their processing is minimized , in order to avoid production of a paste - like product . although the specific order of the processing steps discussed below represents the preferred method of practicing the invention , other variations which would delay processing of the rolled oats are also intended to be encompassed within the invention . for example , the steel - cut oats may be first hydrated , combined with the oat bran , and then cooked , with subsequent addition of rolled oats and optionally further cooking for a short time . in a preferred embodiment of the fresh pack process , the steel cut oats and water are cooked at a rolling boil for about 5 to 15 minutes , preferably about 10 minutes , at about 15 - 18 psi . the rolled oats are then added and the mixture is cooked for an additional approximately 3 to 8 minutes . the oat bran is then added and cooking is continued for up to about 3 minutes . preferably , the bran is previously hydrated to shorten cooking time , e . g . , soaked for about 1 to 5 minutes in hot water . the mixture is then transferred to containers , e . g . , through a pump system and chilled to about 40 ° to 85 ° f . , preferably to approximately 50 ° to 80 ° f . the container and oatmeal may be cooled using a variety of conventional container cooling techniques , e . g . , contact with cold water or gas , refrigeration , etc . depending on the desired end use of the product , the containers may be large pails for food service applications or retail packs for consumer use . where such packaging is not sterile , preservatives are added , generally to the cooking apparatus during processing . among the well known , suitable preservatives are potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate . these and other conventional preservatives may be added according to conventional protocols as is customary in the industry to preserve product freshness . in a preferred embodiment of the hot fill technique , the oatmeal composition can be acidified with suitable ph modifier using an open kettle for the cooking . suitable ph modifiers include glucono delta lactone , apple butter , apple pectin , any naturally acidic flavorings , and combinations thereof . the resulting product can then be filled into containers at an elevated temperature , e . g . , about 140 ° to 160 ° f . , sealed with a removable plastic film , and inverted . preferably , the container is hot filled with about 80 - 98 vol . % oatmeal with the remainder being air that is naturally drawn into the container during the filling step and becomes heated to the oatmeal temperature . an inversion step permits hot air within the container to rise through the oatmeal composition and kill any bacteria that might have been introduced as a result of the open kettle cooking . the result of the inversion is a sterile package . the hot fill product according to the invention has a refrigerated shelf life of approximately 4 - 6 months for a 24 ounce container . the product can be opened and heated on a conventional stove or in a microwave oven set at high for about 45 to 90 seconds depending on the oven power . additional flavoring agents may be added to the cooked product if desired . in either process , an optional flavor fraction may be added during processing , preferably to the steel cut oats . a wide variety of flavors agents may be present but preferably comprise cinnamon , honey or other sweetening material , salt , and vanilla in proportions to taste . cinnamon is desirably present in virtually any physical form at a weight ratio with respect to the overall composition of about 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 %, while honey is desirably added in a weight ratio of about 4 to 12 %. salt can be used in a weight ratio of up to about 0 . 26 % depending on flavor and dietary considerations for the product . vanilla can be added in a weight ratio of 0 . 4 to 1 . 2 %, depending on the vanilla flavor concentration ( fold ). it should be understood that the flavor fraction may contain other ingredients or use widely different proportions for the listed components . taste , style , and economic factors will tend to guide the formulation of the flavor fraction if added to the product at all . in addition , raisins may be included in the composition at any point in the preparation . where raisins are to be added , they are preferably added in the final stages of the procedure . without further elaboration , it is believed that one skilled in the art can , using the preceding description , utilize the present invention to its fullest extent . the following preferred specific embodiments are , therefore , to be construed as merely illustrative , and not limitative , of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever . the entire texts of all applications , patents and publications , if any , cited above and below , are hereby incorporated by reference . table 1______________________________________ingredient wt . % ______________________________________water 73 . 9steel cut oat groats 8 . 0thick rolled oats 8 . 0wildflower honey 8 . 0oat bran 0 . 76mccormick vanilla extract ( v -

SumyLsa,"structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . the parabens , e . g . , methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . 4 gm of guar gum powder ( commercially available as jaguar ® hp - 11 from the stein hall co . ) is added slowly with constant stirring until homogeneously dispersed . ","a cohesive nonsticky electrically conductive gel is disclosed , for facilitating low resistance contact between a metal electrode and a biological body . the gel comprises an aqueous solution of up to saturated concentrations of ionized salts as the conducting agent , a natural gum capable of crosslinking , and a crosslinking material which provides the electrically conductive gel with sufficient internal strength to remain cohesive without reinforcement . the gel has good electrical characteristics and improved physical properties which prevent the gel from leaving a messy residue on the skin of the patient or on the electrode .","the present invention provides an electrolyte gel based on a crosslinked natural gum as the thickening agent . the preferred gums are guar gum and locust bean gum . structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . one feature of the natural gums is their ready availability and low cost . a feature of guar gum is that it can be obtained in a rather pure state without extensive processing . guar gum in its natural state is relatively pure , having very few impurities such as sulphur ( sometimes found in agar ) or extraneous ions ( as found in many of the less pure gums ). a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . in addition , the natural ph of guar gum gels of this invention is approximately 7 - 8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e . , high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g . , the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g . , temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc . , a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g . , methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

SumyLsa,"in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . ","a log rolling apparatus includes a body having a depression or well positioned therein and a large sheet of canvas or similar flexible material positioned over the body and the well . the canvas is fixedly attached to respective ends of the body and a dual link pivotal member is provided to which is attached a roller movable between the body and the canvas . sheets of flammable material and optionally other burnable material , such as leaves or the like , may be placed within the well over the top surface of the canvas , and the pivotal member may then be rotated about the body in a manner which causes the canvas to attempt to follow the roller attached to the member , thus causing the top surface of the canvas to slide against itself so as to roll up the flammable sheet material into a log shape with the leaves , if used , enclosed by the sheet material .","with reference now to the drawings and in particular to fig1 a log rolling apparatus incorporating the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be discussed in detail . specifically , fig1 shows the log rolling apparatus 10 as including a body member 12 having a topmost curved surface 14 extending over a substantial portion of the body member , and further including a depression or well 16 formed therein as an integral part thereof . further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . viewing fig1 and 2 together , it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus 10 further includes a rotation member 28 which is formed from a pair of first pivot arms 30 , 32 pivotally attached to opposed sides 34 , 36 , respectively , of the body member 12 and second pivot arms 38 , 40 respectively pivotally attached to the pivot arms 30 , 32 . additionally , the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are connected together through the use of a handle member 42 in the manner illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , the roller 52 is rotatably positioned on a roller shaft 56 fixedly secured to the second pivot arms 38 , 40 , while spring 57 is provided which is attached between the body member 12 and the pivotable arm 30 so as to facilitate a return of the rotation member 28 to the position shown in fig1 . as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention ."

","a cohesive nonsticky electrically conductive gel is disclosed , for facilitating low resistance contact between a metal electrode and a biological body . the gel comprises an aqueous solution of up to saturated concentrations of ionized salts as the conducting agent , a natural gum capable of crosslinking , and a crosslinking material which provides the electrically conductive gel with sufficient internal strength to remain cohesive without reinforcement . the gel has good electrical characteristics and improved physical properties which prevent the gel from leaving a messy residue on the skin of the patient or on the electrode .","the present invention provides an electrolyte gel based on a crosslinked natural gum as the thickening agent . the preferred gums are guar gum and locust bean gum . structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . one feature of the natural gums is their ready availability and low cost . a feature of guar gum is that it can be obtained in a rather pure state without extensive processing . guar gum in its natural state is relatively pure , having very few impurities such as sulphur ( sometimes found in agar ) or extraneous ions ( as found in many of the less pure gums ). a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . in addition , the natural ph of guar gum gels of this invention is approximately 7 - 8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e . , high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g . , the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g . , temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc . , a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g . , methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

SumyLexRank,"as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . ","a log rolling apparatus includes a body having a depression or well positioned therein and a large sheet of canvas or similar flexible material positioned over the body and the well . the canvas is fixedly attached to respective ends of the body and a dual link pivotal member is provided to which is attached a roller movable between the body and the canvas . sheets of flammable material and optionally other burnable material , such as leaves or the like , may be placed within the well over the top surface of the canvas , and the pivotal member may then be rotated about the body in a manner which causes the canvas to attempt to follow the roller attached to the member , thus causing the top surface of the canvas to slide against itself so as to roll up the flammable sheet material into a log shape with the leaves , if used , enclosed by the sheet material .","with reference now to the drawings and in particular to fig1 a log rolling apparatus incorporating the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be discussed in detail . specifically , fig1 shows the log rolling apparatus 10 as including a body member 12 having a topmost curved surface 14 extending over a substantial portion of the body member , and further including a depression or well 16 formed therein as an integral part thereof . further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . viewing fig1 and 2 together , it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus 10 further includes a rotation member 28 which is formed from a pair of first pivot arms 30 , 32 pivotally attached to opposed sides 34 , 36 , respectively , of the body member 12 and second pivot arms 38 , 40 respectively pivotally attached to the pivot arms 30 , 32 . additionally , the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are connected together through the use of a handle member 42 in the manner illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , the roller 52 is rotatably positioned on a roller shaft 56 fixedly secured to the second pivot arms 38 , 40 , while spring 57 is provided which is attached between the body member 12 and the pivotable arm 30 so as to facilitate a return of the rotation member 28 to the position shown in fig1 . as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention ."

SumyTextRank,"the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . 9 %( methylparaben ) water to 100 % ______________________________________ raising the amount of guar gum increases the viscosity of the gel , and conversely lowering the amount of guar gum decreases the viscosity of the gel . raising the chloride ion concentration increases the electrical conductivity of the gel and decreases the gel - skin impedance , and conversely lowering the chloride ion concentration decreases the electrical conductivity of the gel and increases gel - skin impedance . raising the borate ion concentration increases the degree of crosslinking and the stiffness of the gel , and conversely lowering the borate ion concentration decreases the degree of crosslinking and thus the stiffness of the gel . ","a cohesive nonsticky electrically conductive gel is disclosed , for facilitating low resistance contact between a metal electrode and a biological body . the gel comprises an aqueous solution of up to saturated concentrations of ionized salts as the conducting agent , a natural gum capable of crosslinking , and a crosslinking material which provides the electrically conductive gel with sufficient internal strength to remain cohesive without reinforcement . the gel has good electrical characteristics and improved physical properties which prevent the gel from leaving a messy residue on the skin of the patient or on the electrode .","the present invention provides an electrolyte gel based on a crosslinked natural gum as the thickening agent . the preferred gums are guar gum and locust bean gum . structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . one feature of the natural gums is their ready availability and low cost . a feature of guar gum is that it can be obtained in a rather pure state without extensive processing . guar gum in its natural state is relatively pure , having very few impurities such as sulphur ( sometimes found in agar ) or extraneous ions ( as found in many of the less pure gums ). a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . in addition , the natural ph of guar gum gels of this invention is approximately 7 - 8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e . , high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g . , the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g . , temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc . , a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g . , methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

SumyTextRank,"as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . ","a log rolling apparatus includes a body having a depression or well positioned therein and a large sheet of canvas or similar flexible material positioned over the body and the well . the canvas is fixedly attached to respective ends of the body and a dual link pivotal member is provided to which is attached a roller movable between the body and the canvas . sheets of flammable material and optionally other burnable material , such as leaves or the like , may be placed within the well over the top surface of the canvas , and the pivotal member may then be rotated about the body in a manner which causes the canvas to attempt to follow the roller attached to the member , thus causing the top surface of the canvas to slide against itself so as to roll up the flammable sheet material into a log shape with the leaves , if used , enclosed by the sheet material .","with reference now to the drawings and in particular to fig1 a log rolling apparatus incorporating the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be discussed in detail . specifically , fig1 shows the log rolling apparatus 10 as including a body member 12 having a topmost curved surface 14 extending over a substantial portion of the body member , and further including a depression or well 16 formed therein as an integral part thereof . further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . viewing fig1 and 2 together , it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus 10 further includes a rotation member 28 which is formed from a pair of first pivot arms 30 , 32 pivotally attached to opposed sides 34 , 36 , respectively , of the body member 12 and second pivot arms 38 , 40 respectively pivotally attached to the pivot arms 30 , 32 . additionally , the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are connected together through the use of a handle member 42 in the manner illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , the roller 52 is rotatably positioned on a roller shaft 56 fixedly secured to the second pivot arms 38 , 40 , while spring 57 is provided which is attached between the body member 12 and the pivotable arm 30 so as to facilitate a return of the rotation member 28 to the position shown in fig1 . as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention ."

cut oats may be cooked separately , combined with previously hydrated oat bran , and then cooked with rolled oats for a short time . in the &# 34 ; hot fill &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; fresh pack &# 34 ; processes , when the steel cut oats and oat bran have been mixed and soaked , the cut oat / bran mixture may be transferred to a holding reservoir or cooking apparatus , e . g . , an open kettle . this transfer step may be through a series of pipes or other handling apparatus . the rate and amount of shear that is induced is desirably minimized to preserve the texture of the steel cut oats and the oat bran while assuring adequate mixing to avoid clumping . rolled oats ( otherwise known as oat flakes ) are added to the cut oat / bran mixture in the cooking apparatus . the rolled oats are even more preferably added before the cut oat / bran mix is passed to the reservoir , where a reservoir is used , to minimize shear forces on the flakes and thereby preserve their texture . in both the hot - fill and fresh pack processes , it is desirable to add the rolled oats at a point in the preparation so that their processing is minimized , in order to avoid production of a paste - like product . although the specific order of the processing steps discussed below represents the preferred method of practicing the invention , other variations which would delay processing of the rolled oats are also intended to be encompassed within the invention . for example , the steel - cut oats may be first hydrated , combined with the oat bran , and then cooked , with subsequent addition of rolled oats and optionally further cooking for a short time . in a preferred embodiment of the fresh pack process , the steel cut oats and water are cooked at a rolling boil for about 5 to 15 minutes , preferably about 10 minutes , at about 15 - 18 psi . the rolled oats are then added and the mixture is cooked for an additional approximately 3 to 8 minutes . the oat bran is then added and cooking is continued for up to about 3 minutes . preferably , the bran is previously hydrated to shorten cooking time , e . g . , soaked for about 1 to 5 minutes in hot water . the mixture is then transferred to containers , e . g . , through a pump system and chilled to about 40 ° to 85 ° f . , preferably to approximately 50 ° to 80 ° f . the container and oatmeal may be cooled using a variety of conventional container cooling techniques , e . g . , contact with cold water or gas , refrigeration , etc . depending on the desired end use of the product , the containers may be large pails for food service applications or retail packs for consumer use . where such packaging is not sterile , preservatives are added , generally to the cooking apparatus during processing . among the well known , suitable preservatives are potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate . these and other conventional preservatives may be added according to conventional protocols as is customary in the industry to preserve product freshness . in a preferred embodiment of the hot fill technique , the oatmeal composition can be acidified with suitable ph modifier using an open kettle for the cooking . suitable ph modifiers include glucono delta lactone , apple butter , apple pectin , any naturally acidic flavorings , and combinations thereof . the resulting product can then be filled into containers at an elevated temperature , e . g . , about 140 ° to 160 ° f . , sealed with a removable plastic film , and inverted . preferably , the container is hot filled with about 80 - 98 vol . % oatmeal with the remainder being air that is naturally drawn into the container during the filling step and becomes heated to the oatmeal temperature . an inversion step permits hot air within the container to rise through the oatmeal composition and kill any bacteria that might have been introduced as a result of the open kettle cooking . the result of the inversion is a sterile package . the hot fill product according to the invention has a refrigerated shelf life of approximately 4 - 6 months for a 24 ounce container . the product can be opened and heated on a conventional stove or in a microwave oven set at high for about 45 to 90 seconds depending on the oven power . additional flavoring agents may be added to the cooked product if desired . in either process , an optional flavor fraction may be added during processing , preferably to the steel cut oats . a wide variety of flavors agents may be present but preferably comprise cinnamon , honey or other sweetening material , salt , and vanilla in proportions to taste . cinnamon is desirably present in virtually any physical form at a weight ratio with respect to the overall composition of about 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 %, while honey is desirably added in a weight ratio of about 4 to 12 %. salt can be used in a weight ratio of up to about 0 . 26 % depending on flavor and dietary considerations for the product . vanilla can be added in a weight ratio of 0 . 4 to 1 . 2 %, depending on the vanilla flavor concentration ( fold ). it should be understood that the flavor fraction may contain other ingredients or use widely different proportions for the listed components . taste , style , and economic factors will tend to guide the formulation of the flavor fraction if added to the product at all . in addition , raisins may be included in the composition at any point in the preparation . where raisins are to be added , they are preferably added in the final stages of the procedure . without further elaboration , it is believed that one skilled in the art can , using the preceding description , utilize the present invention to its fullest extent . the following preferred specific embodiments are , therefore , to be construed as merely illustrative , and not limitative , of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever . the entire texts of all applications , patents and publications , if any , cited above and below , are hereby incorporated by reference . table 1______________________________________ingredient wt . % ______________________________________water 73 . 9steel cut oat groats 8 . 0thick rolled oats 8 . 0wildflower honey 8 . 0oat bran 0 . 76mccormick vanilla extract ( v -

SumySumBasic,"in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . 9 %( methylparaben ) water to 100 % ______________________________________ raising the amount of guar gum increases the viscosity of the gel , and conversely lowering the amount of guar gum decreases the viscosity of the gel . 4propylene glycol 15 . 02potassium tetraborate 0 . ","a cohesive nonsticky electrically conductive gel is disclosed , for facilitating low resistance contact between a metal electrode and a biological body . the gel comprises an aqueous solution of up to saturated concentrations of ionized salts as the conducting agent , a natural gum capable of crosslinking , and a crosslinking material which provides the electrically conductive gel with sufficient internal strength to remain cohesive without reinforcement . the gel has good electrical characteristics and improved physical properties which prevent the gel from leaving a messy residue on the skin of the patient or on the electrode .","the present invention provides an electrolyte gel based on a crosslinked natural gum as the thickening agent . the preferred gums are guar gum and locust bean gum . structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . one feature of the natural gums is their ready availability and low cost . a feature of guar gum is that it can be obtained in a rather pure state without extensive processing . guar gum in its natural state is relatively pure , having very few impurities such as sulphur ( sometimes found in agar ) or extraneous ions ( as found in many of the less pure gums ). a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . in addition , the natural ph of guar gum gels of this invention is approximately 7 - 8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e . , high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g . , the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g . , temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc . , a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g . , methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

SumySumBasic,"with reference now to the drawings and in particular to fig1 a log rolling apparatus incorporating the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be discussed in detail . further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . ","a log rolling apparatus includes a body having a depression or well positioned therein and a large sheet of canvas or similar flexible material positioned over the body and the well . the canvas is fixedly attached to respective ends of the body and a dual link pivotal member is provided to which is attached a roller movable between the body and the canvas . sheets of flammable material and optionally other burnable material , such as leaves or the like , may be placed within the well over the top surface of the canvas , and the pivotal member may then be rotated about the body in a manner which causes the canvas to attempt to follow the roller attached to the member , thus causing the top surface of the canvas to slide against itself so as to roll up the flammable sheet material into a log shape with the leaves , if used , enclosed by the sheet material .","with reference now to the drawings and in particular to fig1 a log rolling apparatus incorporating the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be discussed in detail . specifically , fig1 shows the log rolling apparatus 10 as including a body member 12 having a topmost curved surface 14 extending over a substantial portion of the body member , and further including a depression or well 16 formed therein as an integral part thereof . further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . viewing fig1 and 2 together , it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus 10 further includes a rotation member 28 which is formed from a pair of first pivot arms 30 , 32 pivotally attached to opposed sides 34 , 36 , respectively , of the body member 12 and second pivot arms 38 , 40 respectively pivotally attached to the pivot arms 30 , 32 . additionally , the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are connected together through the use of a handle member 42 in the manner illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , the roller 52 is rotatably positioned on a roller shaft 56 fixedly secured to the second pivot arms 38 , 40 , while spring 57 is provided which is attached between the body member 12 and the pivotable arm 30 so as to facilitate a return of the rotation member 28 to the position shown in fig1 . as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention ."

75 % on u . s . # 20 , 10 - 30 % on u . s . # 30 , and 10 % maximum in the pan at an overall density of about 30 - 32 lb / cu . ft . when the steel cut oats and oat bran have been mixed and soaked , the cut oat / bran mixture is desirably transferred to a holding reservoir . this transfer step may be through a series of pipes or other handling apparatus . the rate and amount of shear that is induced is desirably minimized to preserve the texture of the steel cut oats and the oat bran while assuring adequate mixing to avoid clumping . rolled oats ( otherwise known as oat flakes ) can be added at any point in the process before cooking the mixture . desirably , they are added to the cut oat / bran mixture in the holding reservoir . the rolled oats are even more preferably added before the cut oat / bran mix is passed to the reservoir to minimize shear forces on the flakes and thereby preserve their texture . the oat mixture containing cut oats , bran , and flakes is then heated to a temperature of about 250 ° to 325 ° f . for a time sufficient to cook the oatmeal fractions , e . g . for 15 seconds to about 2 minutes , depending on the temperature . it is preferable to maintain aseptic conditions during the cooking and avoid the introduction of any microorganisms or bacteria which could adversely affect the food product . for that reason , conventional aseptic processing equipment such as closed kettles and heating tubes are desirably used . this aseptic product has a shelf like under refrigeration at 40 °- 50 ° f . of about 4 - 6 months . if the storage conditions of the aseptically packaged product are likely to be at temperatures above 75 ° f . for an extended period of time , it may be desirable to add a small quantity of preservative to ensure the safety of the food composition . among the well known , suitable preservatives are potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate . further , where aseptic packaging conditions are not used , conventional preservatives may be added according to conventional protocols as is customary in the industry to preserve product freshness . in the retort preparation , the steel cut oats and oat bran mixture is heated to a temperature of about 150 ° f . to about 220 ° f . , preferably at least 180 ° f . the rolled oats are then added , and the entire mixture is simmered for about 2 to 5 minutes . preferably , the mixture is simmered for about 3 minutes . the mixture is subsequently placed into containers such as bowls or pouches designed as retail or wholesale packaging for the product and additionally cooked for a time sufficient to produce an edible composition . cooking time in the containers is affected by container size and thickness , with larger and / or denser containers requiring longer cooking times . preferred cooking time in containers is about 13 minutes to 1 hour and 25 minutes . preferred cooking temperature is at least about 250 ° f . , more preferably 250 ° to about 310 ° f . further , rotation of the container may be performed , which rotation further shortens cooking time . rotation of the containers of up to 15 rpm may be used . flavorings may be added , as discussed above . in addition , raisins may be included in the composition at any point in the preparation . where raisins are to be added , they are preferably added in the final stages of the procedure . when cooking is complete , the containers are sealed and may be heated to sanitize the contents . alternatively , conventional preservatives may be added . in both the optional aseptic and retort processes above , it is desirable to add the rolled oats at a point in the preparation so that their processing is minimized , in order to avoid production of a paste - like product . although the specific order of the steps discussed above represents the preferred methods of practicing the invention , other variations which would delay processing of the rolled oats are also intended to be encompassed within the invention . for example , the steel - cut oats may be cooked separately , combined with previously hydrated oat bran , and then cooked with rolled oats for a short time . in the &# 34 ; hot fill &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; fresh pack &# 34 ; processes , when the steel cut oats and oat bran have been mixed and soaked , the cut oat / bran mixture may be transferred to a holding reservoir or cooking apparatus , e . g . , an open kettle . this transfer step may be through a series of pipes or other handling apparatus . the rate and amount of shear that is induced is desirably minimized to preserve the texture of the steel cut oats and the oat bran while assuring adequate mixing to avoid clumping . rolled oats ( otherwise known as oat flakes ) are added to the cut oat / bran mixture in the cooking apparatus . the rolled oats are even more preferably added before the cut oat / bran mix is passed to the reservoir , where a reservoir is used , to minimize shear forces on the flakes and thereby preserve their texture . in both the hot - fill and fresh pack processes , it is desirable to add the rolled oats at a point in the preparation so that their processing is minimized , in order to avoid production of a paste - like product . although the specific order of the processing steps discussed below represents the preferred method of practicing the invention , other variations which would delay processing of the rolled oats are also intended to be encompassed within the invention . for example , the steel - cut oats may be first hydrated , combined with the oat bran , and then cooked , with subsequent addition of rolled oats and optionally further cooking for a short time . in a preferred embodiment of the fresh pack process , the steel cut oats and water are cooked at a rolling boil for about 5 to 15 minutes , preferably about 10 minutes , at about 15 - 18 psi . the rolled oats are then added and the mixture is cooked for an additional approximately 3 to 8 minutes . the oat bran is then added and cooking is continued for up to about 3 minutes . preferably , the bran is previously hydrated to shorten cooking time , e . g . , soaked for about 1 to 5 minutes in hot water . the mixture is then transferred to containers , e . g . , through a pump system and chilled to about 40 ° to 85 ° f . , preferably to approximately 50 ° to 80 ° f . the container and oatmeal may be cooled using a variety of conventional container cooling techniques , e . g . , contact with cold water or gas , refrigeration , etc . depending on the desired end use of the product , the containers may be large pails for food service applications or retail packs for consumer use . where such packaging is not sterile , preservatives are added , generally to the cooking apparatus during processing . among the well known , suitable preservatives are potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate . these and other conventional preservatives may be added according to conventional protocols as is customary in the industry to preserve product freshness . in a preferred embodiment of the hot fill technique , the oatmeal composition can be acidified with suitable ph modifier using an open kettle for the cooking . suitable ph modifiers include glucono delta lactone , apple butter , apple pectin , any naturally acidic flavorings , and combinations thereof . the resulting product can then be filled into containers at an elevated temperature , e . g . , about 140 ° to 160 ° f . , sealed with a removable plastic film , and inverted . preferably , the container is hot filled with about 80 - 98 vol . % oatmeal with the remainder being air that is naturally drawn into the container during the filling step and becomes heated to the oatmeal temperature . an inversion step permits hot air within the container to rise through the oatmeal composition and kill any bacteria that might have been introduced as a result of the open kettle cooking . the result of the inversion is a sterile package . the hot fill product according to the invention has a refrigerated shelf life of approximately 4 - 6 months for a 24 ounce container . the product can be opened and heated on a conventional stove or in a microwave oven set at high for about 45 to 90 seconds depending on the oven power . additional flavoring agents may be added to the cooked product if desired . in either process , an optional flavor fraction may be added during processing , preferably to the steel cut oats . a wide variety of flavors agents may be present but preferably comprise cinnamon , honey or other sweetening material , salt , and vanilla in proportions to taste . cinnamon is desirably present in virtually any physical form at a weight ratio with respect to the overall composition of about 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 %, while honey is desirably added in a weight ratio of about 4 to 12 %. salt can be used in a weight ratio of up to about 0 . 26 % depending on flavor and dietary considerations for the product . vanilla can be added in a weight ratio of 0 . 4 to 1 . 2 %, depending on the vanilla flavor concentration ( fold ). it should be understood that the flavor fraction may contain other ingredients or use widely different proportions for the listed components . taste , style , and economic factors will tend to guide the formulation of the flavor fraction if added to the product at all . in addition , raisins may be included in the composition at any point in the preparation . where raisins are to be added , they are preferably added in the final stages of the procedure . without further elaboration , it is believed that one skilled in the art can , using the preceding description , utilize the present invention to its fullest extent . the following preferred specific embodiments are , therefore , to be construed as merely illustrative , and not limitative , of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever . the entire texts of all applications , patents and publications , if any , cited above and below , are hereby incorporated by reference . table 1______________________________________ingredient wt . % ______________________________________water 73 . 9steel cut oat groats 8 . 0thick rolled oats 8 . 0wildflower honey 8 . 0oat bran 0 . 76mccormick vanilla extract ( v -

SumyKL,"preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . 8 to 25 % potassium tetraborate 0 . 9 %( methylparaben ) water to 100 % ______________________________________ raising the amount of guar gum increases the viscosity of the gel , and conversely lowering the amount of guar gum decreases the viscosity of the gel . 9 gm of sodium chloride , 0 . ","a cohesive nonsticky electrically conductive gel is disclosed , for facilitating low resistance contact between a metal electrode and a biological body . the gel comprises an aqueous solution of up to saturated concentrations of ionized salts as the conducting agent , a natural gum capable of crosslinking , and a crosslinking material which provides the electrically conductive gel with sufficient internal strength to remain cohesive without reinforcement . the gel has good electrical characteristics and improved physical properties which prevent the gel from leaving a messy residue on the skin of the patient or on the electrode .","the present invention provides an electrolyte gel based on a crosslinked natural gum as the thickening agent . the preferred gums are guar gum and locust bean gum . structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . one feature of the natural gums is their ready availability and low cost . a feature of guar gum is that it can be obtained in a rather pure state without extensive processing . guar gum in its natural state is relatively pure , having very few impurities such as sulphur ( sometimes found in agar ) or extraneous ions ( as found in many of the less pure gums ). a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . in addition , the natural ph of guar gum gels of this invention is approximately 7 - 8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e . , high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g . , the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g . , temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc . , a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g . , methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

SumyKL,"specifically , fig1 shows the log rolling apparatus 10 as including a body member 12 having a topmost curved surface 14 extending over a substantial portion of the body member , and further including a depression or well 16 formed therein as an integral part thereof . in this connection , the roller 52 is rotatably positioned on a roller shaft 56 fixedly secured to the second pivot arms 38 , 40 , while spring 57 is provided which is attached between the body member 12 and the pivotable arm 30 so as to facilitate a return of the rotation member 28 to the position shown in fig1 . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . ","a log rolling apparatus includes a body having a depression or well positioned therein and a large sheet of canvas or similar flexible material positioned over the body and the well . the canvas is fixedly attached to respective ends of the body and a dual link pivotal member is provided to which is attached a roller movable between the body and the canvas . sheets of flammable material and optionally other burnable material , such as leaves or the like , may be placed within the well over the top surface of the canvas , and the pivotal member may then be rotated about the body in a manner which causes the canvas to attempt to follow the roller attached to the member , thus causing the top surface of the canvas to slide against itself so as to roll up the flammable sheet material into a log shape with the leaves , if used , enclosed by the sheet material .","with reference now to the drawings and in particular to fig1 a log rolling apparatus incorporating the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be discussed in detail . specifically , fig1 shows the log rolling apparatus 10 as including a body member 12 having a topmost curved surface 14 extending over a substantial portion of the body member , and further including a depression or well 16 formed therein as an integral part thereof . further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . viewing fig1 and 2 together , it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus 10 further includes a rotation member 28 which is formed from a pair of first pivot arms 30 , 32 pivotally attached to opposed sides 34 , 36 , respectively , of the body member 12 and second pivot arms 38 , 40 respectively pivotally attached to the pivot arms 30 , 32 . additionally , the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are connected together through the use of a handle member 42 in the manner illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , the roller 52 is rotatably positioned on a roller shaft 56 fixedly secured to the second pivot arms 38 , 40 , while spring 57 is provided which is attached between the body member 12 and the pivotable arm 30 so as to facilitate a return of the rotation member 28 to the position shown in fig1 . as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention ."

8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e . , high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g . , the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g . , temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc . , a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g . , methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

SumyReduction,"as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . ","a log rolling apparatus includes a body having a depression or well positioned therein and a large sheet of canvas or similar flexible material positioned over the body and the well . the canvas is fixedly attached to respective ends of the body and a dual link pivotal member is provided to which is attached a roller movable between the body and the canvas . sheets of flammable material and optionally other burnable material , such as leaves or the like , may be placed within the well over the top surface of the canvas , and the pivotal member may then be rotated about the body in a manner which causes the canvas to attempt to follow the roller attached to the member , thus causing the top surface of the canvas to slide against itself so as to roll up the flammable sheet material into a log shape with the leaves , if used , enclosed by the sheet material .","with reference now to the drawings and in particular to fig1 a log rolling apparatus incorporating the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be discussed in detail . specifically , fig1 shows the log rolling apparatus 10 as including a body member 12 having a topmost curved surface 14 extending over a substantial portion of the body member , and further including a depression or well 16 formed therein as an integral part thereof . further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . viewing fig1 and 2 together , it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus 10 further includes a rotation member 28 which is formed from a pair of first pivot arms 30 , 32 pivotally attached to opposed sides 34 , 36 , respectively , of the body member 12 and second pivot arms 38 , 40 respectively pivotally attached to the pivot arms 30 , 32 . additionally , the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are connected together through the use of a handle member 42 in the manner illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , the roller 52 is rotatably positioned on a roller shaft 56 fixedly secured to the second pivot arms 38 , 40 , while spring 57 is provided which is attached between the body member 12 and the pivotable arm 30 so as to facilitate a return of the rotation member 28 to the position shown in fig1 . as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention ."
