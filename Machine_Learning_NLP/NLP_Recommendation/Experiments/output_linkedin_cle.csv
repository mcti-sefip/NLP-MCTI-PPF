Josephine Sarpong Akosa;South Bend, Indiana, United States;Researcher | Experienced Data Scientist | Statistician | Data Enthusiast;I am currently a Research Assistant Professor of IT, Analytics, and Operations in the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame. My research interest is in high-dimensional statistical inference. Rapid advancement in technology has allowed an accelerated increase in the amount of data collected in many research fields, thereby allowing for thousands or millions of null hypotheses to be tested simultaneously with a relatively small number of experimental units. The general characteristics associated with such inferential problems are: 1) the dimension of the data is much larger than the sample size, 2) there is complex, mostly uncharacterized dependencies among the variables under consideration, 3) error rates are inflated due to simultaneous hypotheses testing, and 4) some of the null hypotheses are expected to be true. Traditional methods for simultaneous inference are designed in the realm of independent and normally distributed data with the number of samples being larger than the dimension of the data, when in fact these are not the general characteristics of high-dimensional inferential problems. Thus, there is a need to develop multiple testing procedures that exploit the general characteristics of high-dimensional data. I focus on developing powerful multiple comparison procedures for non-normally distributed data that incorporate small sample adaptations to estimation procedures of the model parameters. I have also worked on projects involving imbalanced data modeling. Most importantly, I have had great exposure to analyzing and building predictive models on really messy and ''ugly'' high-dimensional real life data. My goal is to work with hardworking and talented individuals within the research or business industry to address some of the world's greatest challenges.

Anusha Kumar;United States;Scientist;I am a highly passionate and experienced protein chemist skilled in high-throughput combinatorial research platform, biophysical characterization of proteins, and formulation development.Despite the long known importance of biophysical characterization in monitoring protein stability, there are several challenges that make it hard to implement these techniques to develop a pharmaceutical product. My interest lies in developing high-throughput biophysical methods that can be used in screening multiple formulations in a short time as well as to study the correlation between biophysical parameters to long term protein stability.I have 6+ years of experience in designing combinatorial research libraries and studying the sequence-stability relationships in four-helix bundles. This has resulted in multiple presentations including in Gordon and ACS conferences. I also have expertise in working with large sets of sequencing data which made me obtain interesting patterns of functional folds in four-helix bundles. My interest and passion in protein stability methods has helped me acquire a lot of skills which include DSC, CD, DSF, DLS, MALS, SPR, CE, MALDI, ESI MS. I have also acquired skills of working with different formulations using DOE in JMP.

Feel free to interact. I have been working with molecular modeling since 2014. Notably, computational tools are widely employed to solve problems in any field, such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. It is not different in chemistry/biochemistry. Simulating systems and processes in a computer can be very cheap and fast, avoiding unnecessary cost and time, an essential feature for any company. My professional history began much earlier than my acceptance in an undergraduate course. I worked in quite different jobs. I worked as a ball boy (on the tennis court), a waiter, a machine operator, and a production assistant. I found myself when I started a chemistry course and started working as an undergraduate researcher in 2014. After that, I got a master's degree in science. Now, I am a Ph.D.(Universidade Federal de Lavras (UFLA), Brazil).My main focus is organic chemistry, but I am also passionate about biochemistry/biology. Although my primary focus is molecular modeling, I also have experience in the wet lab. During my Ph.D., I performed synthesis, infrared (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. I also started studying drug discovery and how this optimization can be done using computational tools such as molecular docking and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR). My professional life demonstrates that I am very comfortable learning different things in different areas. I like the challenge, and I see every situation as an opportunity to obtain more knowledge.I got a basic level in German and Italian.

Eric Goldwyn;New York, New York, United States;NYU Marron | TransitCosts.com;I am currently working on a research project on transit-infrastructure costs with Alon Levy and Elif Ensari at NYU's Marron Institute of Urban Management. We hope to understand why costs vary from country to country, what drives costs, and develop best practices for high-cost countries to adopt so that they can build more transit for each dollar spent. Check out our website: transitcosts.com I am also working with Sound Transit's Technical Advisory Group to explore ways to accelerate project-delivery schedule and contain costs of Sound Transit's $53.8 billion system-expansion plan, ST3. In July 2021, Sound Transit determined that increasing costs have made the current plan unaffordable and seeks to close an estimated $6.5 billion net shortfall.I also teach courses at NYU on urban studies. Courses tend to take a historical approach to cities to understand how things have changed and what the future may look like.I often write things about cities and transport. I will try and post those articles here.I am currently working on a research project on transit-infrastructure costs with Alon Levy and Elif Ensari at NYU's Marron Institute of Urban Management.

Pedro Vormittag;New York, New York, United States;Columbia SIPA | FGV-EAESP | University of São Paulo | Researcher & Writer | Sustainable Development & Human Rights;5 THINGS ABOUT ME1. I'm a Researcher. That's what I've been doing for years on topics like management strategy, social innovation, climate change, geopolitics, clean energy, human rights, and for all kinds of audiences — from government officials, bankers, lawyers, undergraduates, to journalists and their readers, bosses, peers, or employees!2. I love — love! — writing. I don't care if it's a 50-page report that will guide students in a lecture by a Nobel laureate, a policy brief about solar energy in the Amazon for a Minister, or if it's a speech for myself or someone running for office. I also do love reasonable deadlines, but let's face it: those are rare, and time pressure doesn't always have to be the enemy of excellence!3. Sustainable development is my passion. Conversations about climate change (SDG 13), energy transition (SDG 7), and biodiversity (SDG 14, 15) will always get my attention. In my past, I'm proud to have delved into the challenges of creating policies for homeless people (SDG 11) and imprisoned people (SDG 16), as well as sports and leisure policies for older adults (SDG 3), and to have been vocal on the agenda for public education (SDG 4).4. I am interdisciplinary. After all, if someone graduates from Law School, but goes to work with social policy in government, then jumps into a Master's in management & business and lands at Columbia to study energy and climate, I've got to be able to find connections among complex areas — and take pleasure in pitching them to people!5. Speaking of people, I take pride in having dealt with people from the most different backgrounds, values, and expertise in my professional life. Getting a project done is even more exciting when it is the collective product of stakeholders with competing interests (e.g., opposing political parties), leaders from different cultures (e.g., Latin American, Chinese and New Yorkers!), or colleagues with diversified talents (e.g. engineers, lawyers and a soccer players!)5 THINGS ABOUT ME 1.

Quality and expertise matter. - I’ve seen how teams comprised of people with different areas of expertise can work collaboratively to create policies and products that are transformational for teachers and learners. I’ve also seen how deprioritizing quality shortchanges students and educators. Stories can be powerful agents of change. But ultimately it is policy that matters. - I believe that research can uncover powerful stories that can help make the case for change in educational policy and practice. But I also firmly believe that policies need to change in substantial ways if we are to make deep change in service of students and educators.;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAUlI-4BOjAKrsScqH8lAQjma9ELTnZ3a-o

Jose Roberto Ayala Solares;Seattle, Washington, United States;Research Scientist at Amazon;I'm a passionately curious researcher and traveler. Ever since I got my BSc in Mechatronics Engineering in Mexico, I've been pursuing a journey of learning and personal growth that has taken me to live in 7 countries and visited a total of 51 so far.I lived for two years in the sandy lands of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where I got an MSc in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science. There I worked on some research projects related to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and wireless sensor networks in cognitive radio regimes.After that, I went back to Mexico, where I lectured for a few months in my alma mater. My main responsibilities were teaching engineering courses focusing on Python for robotics, numerical methods in MATLAB, and control engineering.Later on, I got interested in machine learning and decided to fly across the Atlantic Ocean again to pursue a Ph.D. from the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at The University Of Sheffield in the United Kingdom. My research focused on modeling and analysis of environmental systems using machine learning, data mining, and system identification techniques. During those years, I self-taught myself R, and all my research was developed in this programming language.Once I got my Ph.D., I worked as a Machine Learning Scientist at the George Institute for Global Health at the University of Oxford. There I employed and developed machine and deep learning algorithms that could find patterns in large multi-modal data for managing some of the healthcare challenges facing the world in the 21st century.Some years ago, I decided to move away from academia and give it a go in industry. I currently work for Amazon in the United States. My main work consists of building mathematical models for demand forecasting of Amazon devices.When I'm not working (from home), I'm learning something new, improving my coding skills, watching documentaries, reading fantasy/sci-fi/science, exploring the city I'm currently living at, or planning my next trip.I'm a passionately curious researcher and traveler.

Marco Ataide;San Francisco, California, United States;Scientist (Inflammation);Experimental Immunologist.Topics of interest: Inflammation, Immunotherapy, Immuno-oncology, CD8+ T and unconventional T cells immunobiology, Chimeric Antigen Receptors Modified CAR-T/NK cells, and basic Innate and Adaptive ImmunobiologyI have been focusing my research on the fundamental questions of how the immune system operates at a cellular and molecular level in steady-state and under pathogen-induced inflammation.I classify myself as an experimental immunologist with substantial hands-on in vivo and in vitro experimental settings. I have developed in-depth knowledge and practical skills in cutting-edge technologies, such as Multi-parametric Flow Cytometry (classical and spectrum analyzers), Single-Cell Sequencing Analysis (scRNAseq), and Microscopy (confocal and intravital imaging). I also had the chance to guide and train several students at different levels during all of these years working in academia.I have been working with different types of cells (in vitro and in vivo). However, I have a particular passion for T-cell-based immune responses. I have had a remarkable chance to assess a piece of the molecular network controlling the in vivo development of memory CD8 T cells. In this study, which was published in Nature Immunology (2020), I have found that the transcription factor BATF3 programs CD8 T cell memory opening up a new opportunity for T cell engineering to fight cancer.Another important study that came out of my postdoctoral training, deals with novel concepts in unconventional T cells (UTC) immunobiology, where we show how UTC promotes site-specific immunity in different lymph nodes ( Immunity in press, 2022 )Complete publication list: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=ataide+maExperimental Immunologist.

This technical expertise, coupled with university and executive-level teaching experience, enables me to transform research insights into thought leadership and action plans that enable organizations to thrive. I thrive on cross-functional and multidisciplinary teams given the type of research I have conducted and given my work with different types of audiences.My research tends to be centered on causal inference and measurement work. I enjoy staying on the cutting edge of methods useful for the questions at hand. Approaches I have employed include: differences-in-differences (DiD), selection models, linear regression, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs (RDD), financial market event studies, synthetic control, Monte Carlo simulation/randomization inference, randomized A/B experiments, item response theory (IRT), geographic information systems (GIS), natural language processing (NLP), and off-the-shelf machine learning (ML) algorithms. I have applied these methods to datasets (many of which I have built) on lobbying, campaign contributions, notice-and-comment rulemaking, corporate political geography, and metrics of corporate social responsibility (CSR) / sustainability often merged with those on the market environment in which firms compete and on firm performance. Prior to earning my PhD, I worked in both public & private sectors (at technology firms & in finance), in the U.S. and internationally, including time with the Federal Reserve (in Washington DC & San Francisco), the Central Intelligence Agency (in Langley), the Japan External Trade Organization (in New York), the US Army Research Laboratory (in Adelphi, MD), Nomura Securities (in New York), Sanwa Bank (in Tokyo), Nokia (in Burlington, MA), ZEFER [a technology start-up] (in Boston), and The Motley Fool (in Alexandria, VA).I earned my PhD in Global Economics & Management from UCLA's Anderson School, an M.A. in Economics from UCLA, an M.P.I.A. in Asian Markets & Economies from UCSD's School of Global Policy & Strategy, and an S.B. in Management Science from MIT's Sloan School of Management.

These approaches ameliorate the problems caused by violations of standard statistical assumptions owing to the nature of economic relationships, and they facilitate the identification of true causal effects from the big data that today's companies have at their disposal. These are questions that A/B tests and predictive algorithms cannot always answer. I use these insights to inform features or policies to drive growth and build long-run value.But what does all that mean?

Bethany Wentz;South Bend-Mishawaka Region;Psychology Researcher at the University of Notre Dame;I am a graduate researcher at the University of Notre Dame studying developmental psychology.My research interests focus broadly on adolescents in contexts of ethnopolitical violence and armed conflict. I am also interested in translating research on political violence and its impact on youth into evidence-based interventions to assuage the negative consequences of violence on youth and bolster protective factors in their communities.My interest in youth and ethnopolitical conflict was sparked by my experience as a Peace Corps Volunteer. I served as a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) Volunteer in Ukraine from 2012 to 2014. My experience was cut short when violence erupted in the capital of Ukraine and eventually spread to many other cities and towns across the country. The violence ultimately escalated into the ongoing civil war in the eastern Donbas region of the country. Watching this situation unfold in Ukraine solidified my interest in youth and ethnopolitical conflict around the globe.Shortly after my time in Ukraine, I was admitted into the dual master’s degree program in International Peace and Conflict Resolution and Counseling at Arcadia University. This blend of interdisciplinary study allowed me to build skills in program design, evaluation, and grant writing while simultaneously honing interpersonal and therapeutic skills.Ultimately, I am interested in a career in international youth development that will allow me to utilize my advanced research and program design, monitoring, and evaluation skills.When I’m not working, I’m experimenting in the kitchen with international dishes or annoying my cat with my love.I am a graduate researcher at the University of Notre Dame studying developmental psychology.

Julia Toscano Leitao;Miami, Florida, United States;BRASA Summer Journey - BTG Pactual | Researcher at Scoutfy | VP & Marketing Director at BRASA FIU;A Senior at Florida International University, starting to look for internships in the Finance and Marketing Field. I am very interest in Math and I love the way social media works. Throughout my whole life, I have experienced wins and losses, since I was a swimmer for 18 years of my life. With the sport in my life, I was able to learn how to be responsible, organized, resilient and hard worker. Being an athlete had taught me that nothing is impossible and that you can achieve everything that you want with focus and perseverance and always believing on yourself. In addition, I have experienced an early personal growth in my life. When I was 15, I received a scholarship to study and swim in a boarding school in Florida. This was not an easy decision to make, since I was a little growing girl, that was about to live in another country, very far from their parents and their friends. However, it was the best decision that I could ever made, since it lead to me new opportunities. As such, I have taken some business courses and some computer courses. And now I would like to apply all the theory that I learned in class into the business world.A Senior at Florida International University, starting to look for internships in the Finance and Marketing Field.
